# Observablehq viewer

This is a local observablehq notebooks viewer. You can download your notebook in javascript format, remove the last export line and put it under the file name "notebook.js". Then open index.html in a browser and you can view and interact with your notebook. 

This was done because Observablehq has not made an external notebook viewer.
